>> ======= CS:GO Quiz

>> Quiz app built to test knowledge on a given topic
>> Project created to see how I could tackle the given problems
>> I learned the basics of nested forloops, and that I need to be careful with how i declare arrays with nested objects and arrays

>> click the start game button to display the current question as well as options to select from to answer current question

>> Checking between corrent and incorrect answers was the most challenging part for me, however if I were to give another shot at this or refactor in the future, I believe I would reformat how I declared my questions array, giving the options a correct or incorrect boolean to make them easier to compare.

>> Another challenge I struggled with was the listing of the possible answers. I think going back and declaring the <li> tags in html then populating those would have worked better than creating and populating all in js.
